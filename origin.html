                    This idea may seem ahead of its time, because it is. None of us actually thought 
of this idea, we were told about it. John Titor, a self proclaimed time traveller,
posted on @channel about the grim dystopian future, to which he belonged, and wanted
to change. In the year 2036, SERN(CERN) takes over the earth and the world goes into complete
anarchy. John believes SERN invented time travel in 2001 itself and used it to transcend 
and overthrow all the political institutions. Titor wanted to make Grid, as a tool to connect and learn
about enemy locations but more importantly as a symbol. A symbol of resistance. Within days, he was ready
with a basic prototype. He and a few more survivors planned to test it on one of their missions to steal SERN
equipment.The plan was simple but there was one flaw left in Grid which was causing a delay in messages. And 
this flaw became a major problem as Grid did not notify about enemey movement patterns in time. And then they were 
spotted. The whole facility was blaring alarms and in a matter of seconds a quite and scientific lab was filled
with mercs. The team managed to pull off a sneaky escape. They decided to resort to the last option, go back in time
and stop all this from happening. 
<br>
We learnt about this on @channel and thought we should help regardless of how crazy and unbelievable it sounds. So we made
Grid, or rather fixed it and tweaked it. The delay bug was squashed, a few neat features were added along with a sweet UI.
In case John fails to defeat the current SERN, he would still have a battle ready Grid. A symbol of resistance.
